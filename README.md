# 👋 Hi, I’m Aliya Shaikh

I’m a **Software Engineer** working on **production-scale web and system-driven applications** using **Django, React, and Java**.

I enjoy building **scalable, secure, and maintainable systems** — especially backend-heavy platforms where architecture, reliability, and performance matter more than just features.

## 🧠 What I Work On

- Backend development with **Python (Django, Django REST Framework)**
- Full-stack development using **React** for clean, responsive UIs
- **Java** for application logic and Android-based projects
- Designing and consuming **RESTful APIs**
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** & admin / super-admin systems
- Secure authentication flows (JWT, OTP, audit logs)
- Relational database design & optimization (**PostgreSQL / MySQL**)
- Debugging and performance improvements across frontend & backend
- Basic deployment & infrastructure setup (**Nginx, cloud-ready environments**)

## 🚀 Current Focus

- Building **SaaS & ERP platforms** with modular architecture
- Writing clean, maintainable backend logic
- Improving system design thinking and scalability
- Exploring **Java & Android development** alongside backend systems
